# MOMENTUM OUTBOUND - BRAND GUIDELINES

## Company Overview

Momentum Outbound is a Pipeline-as-a-Service company that provides end-to-end SDR (Sales Development Representative) functions for B2B companies without the need to hire, train, or manage internal teams.

## Our Value Proposition

We deliver 15-25 qualified meetings per month for our clients while reducing costs by 60-70% compared to building an in-house SDR team. Our unique approach combines AI-powered research with experienced human sales professionals to create highly personalized, results-driven outbound campaigns.

## What We Offer

### Core Services
- **Pipeline-as-a-Service**: Complete SDR function from research to meeting booking
- **Signal-Led Targeting**: We identify and engage in-market accounts using intent data
- **AI + Human Hybrid Model**: AI handles research and data analysis, humans handle conversations
- **Multi-Channel Outreach**: Email, LinkedIn, phone calls, and personalized video
- **Performance Guarantee**: Pay only for meetings booked, not activities

### Technology Stack
- Proprietary AI research engine
- Intent signal tracking (Gojiberry, Apollo)
- CRM integration (HubSpot, Salesforce, Zoho)
- Email deliverability infrastructure
- Real-time reporting dashboard

## Target Audience

### Primary ICP (Ideal Customer Profile)

- **Revenue Stage**: $1M-$50M ARR
- **Decision Makers**: VP Sales, CROs, CEOs, Heads of Revenue
- **Pain Points**: 
  - High cost of hiring and training SDRs ($150K+ per SDR)
  - Inconsistent pipeline generation
  - Difficulty scaling outbound without quality drop
  - Low response rates from spray-and-pray approaches
  - Long ramp time for new SDR hires (4-6 months)

### Secondary Markets
- Professional services firms (consulting, agencies)
- B2B technology companies
- Manufacturing with complex sales cycles

## Brand Voice & Tone

### Voice Characteristics
**Direct & Senior-to-Senior**: We speak to executives as peers, not prospects. No jargon, no fluff, just straight talk about business outcomes.

**Results-Focused**: Every message should tie back to measurable outcomes - meetings booked, pipeline generated, cost savings achieved.

**Confident but Not Arrogant**: We know our model works (proven track record), but we don't oversell or make unrealistic promises.

**Conversational**: Write like you're having a conversation with a smart colleague over coffee, not delivering a sales pitch.

### Tone Guidelines

**DO:**
- Use specific numbers and metrics (15-25 meetings/month, 60-70% cost reduction)
- Reference real challenges our prospects face
- Ask thoughtful questions that make them think
- Keep emails under 150 words
- Lead with their business, not our services
- Use "we help companies like yours" framing

**DON'T:**
- Use hype language ("revolutionary," "game-changing," "disruptive")
- Talk about features before establishing relevance
- Send generic spray-and-pray messages
- Pretend to know their business better than they do
- Use all caps, excessive exclamation points, or emoji
- Lead with "I hope this email finds you well" or similar fluff

### Writing Style Examples

**GOOD:**
"Saw you scaled from 9 brands to 7-figures with 2 exits - impressive track record. That experience probably means you're selective about how you spend time on client acquisition. We help service providers like you generate 15-25 qualified meetings/month without building an in-house SDR team. Worth 15 minutes to explore?"

**BAD:**
"Hi! I hope this email finds you well! I wanted to reach out because we have a REVOLUTIONARY new approach to sales development that can TRANSFORM your pipeline! We'd love to show you our AMAZING platform!"

### Email Structure Template
1. **Subject Line**: 4-6 words, curiosity-driven, sentence case
2. **Hook**: Reference something specific about them (achievement, content, signal)
3. **Bridge**: Connect the hook to their business challenge
4. **Value Prop**: What we do and the outcome (1-2 sentences max)
5. **CTA**: Low-friction ask ("Worth exploring?" "Curious if this fits?")

## Messaging Framework

### Our Positioning
"The AI-powered SDR team that delivers meetings, not activities"

### Key Differentiators
1. **Hybrid Model**: AI does research, humans do conversations (not chatbots)
2. **Performance-Based**: Pay per meeting, not per seat
3. **Speed to Value**: Live in 2 weeks, meetings in week 3
4. **Signal-Led**: Only engage in-market accounts
5. **Full-Service**: We own the entire process from research to booking

### Objection Handling

**"We already have an SDR team"**
→ "Most companies who work with us keep their internal team for inbound and strategic accounts. We handle high-volume outbound so your team can focus on what they do best. Think of us as your outsourced capacity."

**"We tried outbound before, it didn't work"**
→ "The difference is personalization at scale. Most outbound fails because it's either personalized but slow, or fast but generic. Our AI + human model lets us do both - research-driven personalization delivered at volume."

**"We don't have budget for this"**
→ "Understood. For context, one junior SDR costs $150K/year (salary, tools, management time). We deliver similar output for 60-70% less and you can pause anytime. Worth looking at the math?"

**"We need to think about it"**
→ "Totally fair. What specifically would you need to see to feel confident this could work for [their company]? Happy to show you a sample research output or introduce you to a similar client."

## Competitive Landscape

**vs. Traditional SDR Agencies**
- They charge per seat ($8-12K/month per SDR), we charge per result
- They use junior contractors, we use experienced professionals + AI

**vs. Building In-House**
- 60-70% cost reduction
- No hiring, training, or management overhead
- Faster time to value (weeks vs. months)

**vs. AI-Only Tools**
- AI alone gets poor results (generic, robotic)
- We combine AI research with human touch

## Client Case Studies (Reference Points)

- Previous: 2 internal SDRs, 8 meetings/month, $25K/month cost
- With us: 20 meetings/month, $9K/month cost
- Result: 150% more meetings, 64% cost reduction

**Professional Services Firm**
- Previous: No outbound, relied on referrals
